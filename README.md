Application Overview

The topic assigned to me for participation in the coding competition is an Online Voting System. My application was developed using Java Eclipse as the IDE and is connected to an SQL database. This application consists of various modules and makes use of algorithms and data structures. The user will be able to log into the application using their voter ID and password. They will also be able to view the various candidates who stand in the election and will be able to vote for any one of them. The admin however will have the entire control of the system. They will be able to view the voters, add candidates, view the votes and also delete the data. 

Problem statement

A lot of developers have been looking into the Online Voting System recently. For several years, it has been the subject of active study. Developing real-world solutions to the online voting system has been difficult, despite the fact that it is still a developing subject. The system's protection is one of the most common concerns. Because some of these voting systems store personal information about voters, data breaches and identity theft are some of the most prevalent issues. One of the key problems in this framework is the insecure use of web applications and the internet. Both of these issues and problems must be addressed in order to restore public confidence.

Problem solution

The Online Voting System that is being built will be a user-friendly web application that will encourage the public to participate. The device would also not collect any sensitive information from the public, making it safer to use. The voting system as a whole will be automated. As a result, the system would be both cost-effective and time-effective.
